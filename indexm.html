                    In our modern society, people are so preoccupied with chasing “happiness”, and their image of
                    happiness is based on what the media shows: fame, money, glamour, pleasure. The problem is, people
                    will just seek more and more of these things, leading to frustration, disillusion, unhappiness, and
                    exhaustion.

                    Jay wrote this book to help people in modern urban settings live more
                    <u>purposeful and more productive lives.</u> He spent three years living as a monk, and after he
                    returned to modern society, he found that his monk training helped him not just cope, but thrive in
                    the pressures of modern society. Hence, he is on a <i><b> mission to spread monk wisdom across the
                            world. </b></i>

                        The problem most of us face is that we do not <u>consciously and intentionally decide on our
                        values.</u> In other words, we don't pick what we deem as important. We just accept and inherit what
                        other people around us think are important.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>List Your Values</li>
                        <li>Identity the origin of that Value</li>
                        <li>Reflect on whether or not that value aligns with your <b>True Self</b></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p class="cd-1">Jay encourages us to avoid lower values, which demote us to anxiety, depression, and suffering.
                        Instead, we should adopt higher values, which propel us towards happiness, fulfillment, and
                        meaning. He also notes that happiness and success are not values; they are rewards.
                        He then encourages us for one week to be really conscious about making <b> value-driven decisions.</b>
